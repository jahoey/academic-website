### NNOCCI
I am part of the Science Partnership Committee within the National Network for Ocean and Climate Change Interpretation [(NNOCCI)](https://climateinterpreter.org/about/projects/NNOCCI). I was previously a Science Fellow as part of the inaugural Northeast Study Circle in 2017. NNOCCI is a collaboration between informal educators, climate & ocean scientists and communication experts who work together to effectively frame and communicate ocean and climate change science. For useful tools, ideas and events related to communicating ocean and climate change science, check out the [Climate Interpreter website](https://climateinterpreter.org/).

### California Academy of Sciences
Before joining the Pinsky Lab, I volunteered as a SCUBA diver at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, CA. As one of the divers in the daily Coral Reef Dive Shows, I used a full-face mask to talk to visitors about the great diversity of coral reefs, the impacts of ocean acidification on the worldâ€™s reefs and share little-known facts about these amazing ecosystems with the Bay Area community. For a live video feed of the Coral Reef Tank at the California Academy of Sciences, please click [here](https://www.calacademy.org/learn-explore/animal-webcams/philippine-coral-reef-cam) (dive shows are at 11:30am and 2:30pm Pacific Time!).
